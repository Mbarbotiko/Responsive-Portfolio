         <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img id="me" src="assets/images/profile.JPG"alt="Picture of me.">

         <p> I am an adventurous soul with a love for design! I love to travel to beautiful destinations as well as create beautiful things. I am currently studying in the U of M Coding Bootcamp in order to start a career in Front End Web Development.</p>
            
            

         <p> I have spent a decade of my professional time training others, coaching and developing their management skills as well as managing large groups of people.</p>
                
         <p> I spent the first ten years of my professional life working for Burger King.  I learned many skills; time management, people management, composure and temperment management, managing a P & L, everything HR (and MORE!) I ended my career with Burger King as a District Manager two years ago.</p>
                
         <p> I am currently working for Office Depot at a Store Manager. The change of pace has granted me the ability to pursue a career I am more interested in.</p>

            
        <p> On the lighter side of things I have a love for commitment! I have a turtle named Princess who I have had for over 15 years.  My favorite places I have visited so far have been Puerto Rico, Alaska and NYC.</p>
                
         <p> In <a href="pr.html"target=_blank>Puerto Rico</a> I signed up for a trip that seemed fun and adventurous to explore a cave. Little did I know that I would be in the cave for 8 hours and had to zipline and repel into the cave. At the time is seemed impossible, but reminiscing its pretty exciting that I did it! (... at the end they made us rock climb back up, AND I got to see a crab eating a bat! A bat eating crab!) 
                </p>

        <p> <a href="ak.html" target=_blank>Alaska</a> was a little less intense, I rented a car and drove as far as the roads would take me around Anchorage.  From Copper Creek to Seward. Spent a few nights camping, and took a few trips out walking on glaciers and kayaking through some as well. </p>

        <p> The best trip was <a href="nyc.html" target=_blank>NYC</a>, food everywhere!</p>
